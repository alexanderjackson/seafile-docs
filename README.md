# Einführung

Seafile is an open source cloud storage system with advanced
support for file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork.

Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced
separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen password. This
password is not stored on the server, so even the server admin cannot view a
file's contents.

Seafile allows users to create groups with file syncing, wiki, and discussion to
enable easy collaboration around documents within a team.

## Lizenz

Seafile and its desktop and mobile clients are published under the GPLv3.

The Seafile server's web end, i.e. Seahub, is published under the Apache
License.
